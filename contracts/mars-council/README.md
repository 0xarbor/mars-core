# Council

Handles submission, voting and and execution of proposals. As protocol becomes stable, the Council will be the admin of all protocol contracts and have privileges to update most params.

This contract can be considered a fork of [anchor protocol's gov contract](https://github.com/Anchor-Protocol/anchor-token-contracts/tree/main/contracts/gov) which was modified to meet Mars protocol's needs.
